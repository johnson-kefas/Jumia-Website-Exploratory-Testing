The purpose of this project is to evaluate the functionality and usability of the Jumia Kenya website (https://www.jumia.co.ke/) through exploratory testing. We aim to identify potential issues, verify core features are working as expected, and gain insights into the user experience. This testing focuses on key user journeys and functionalities, documenting the results in a structured format to provide a clear overview of the website's current state.
